Power BI Finance Report Dashboard
Overview: I have created 4 different KPI's, 3 Slicers and 5 different charts to get a meaningful insight of the given data.

The 4 KPI's are about the:
i)Total Revenue.
ii)Average Revenue.
ii)Total Transactions. 
iv)Total Countries.

By using the 3 slicers we can get Data according to:
i)Years.
ii)Quarters.
iii)Regions.

Beside that there is a Donut Chart which shows us Total Revenue by Regions. The TreeMap Chart shows us Total Revenue by Ranks. The Area Chart shows us Total Revenue by Quarters. The Bar Chart with Line helps us to understand Total Revenue and Average Revenue by Country. And lastly the ribbon Chart shows us Total Revenue by Products and Ranks.
